            <b>What is Packet Radio?</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Packet radio is a wireless communication technology that involves the transmission of data in small, discrete packets over radio waves. </li>
                <li>It is a subset of packet-switched networking, where data is broken into packets and transmitted individually, then reassembled at the receiving end.</li>
                <li>Packet radio is commonly associated with amateur radio operators (ham radio operators) and has been used for various communication purposes, experimentation, and emergency communication.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="content-table" id="PR-list">
                <b>1. Mesh Network</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">These are decentralized networks where each node can communicate directly with neighboring nodes, forming a self-healing and resilient network. Mesh networks have been used in some local and community-based projects to provide internet access, particularly in remote or underserved areas.</p>

                <b>2. Hyperledger Fabric</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">This is a permissioned blockchain platform designed for enterprise use. While it's not a replacement for the internet itself, it's used for secure and permissioned data sharing and transactions within specific industries or organizations.</p>

                <b>3. Darknet and Decentralized Network</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">Networks like Tor (The Onion Router) and I2P (Invisible Internet Project) provide anonymity and privacy by routing traffic through a distributed network of volunteer-run servers. These networks are used for secure and private browsing and communication.</p>

                <b>4. Peer-to-peer Network</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks allow devices to communicate directly with each other without the need for centralized servers. Technologies like BitTorrent and blockchain-based systems operate on P2P principles.</p>

                <b>5. Alternative DNS System</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">Some projects have proposed alternative domain name systems that aim to decentralize domain registration and management, reducing the control of centralized entities like ICANN.</p>

                <b>6. Interplanetary File System (IPFS)</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">IPFS is a protocol and network designed to create a content-addressable, peer-to-peer method of storing and sharing hypermedia in a distributed file system. It aims to provide a more resilient and decentralized way of sharing data.</p>

                <b>7. Satelite and Wireless Mesh Network</b>
                <p class="content-table" id="PR-elements">In areas with limited or no internet infrastructure, satellite-based networks and wireless mesh networks have been used to provide connectivity.</p>
