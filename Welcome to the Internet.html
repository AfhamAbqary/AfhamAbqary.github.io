            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Internet, has defined by Wikipedia, is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite <a href="InternetJob.html">(TCP/IP)</a> to communicate between networks and devices. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. 
            <p>The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the interlinked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing.
                Despite the widespread use of the Internet in our modern age, it hasn't always been like this. Let us look back at the humble origins of the internet, and how humans created the greatest technology ever concieved.</p>

            <h2>Before the Internet</h2>
            <div id="Quote">
                <p>"<em>Communication – <b>the human connection</b> – is the key to personal and career success.</em>"</p>

            </div>
            <p>&emsp;Long-distance communication was very troubling before the invention of the internet, especially during wartime.
                In Ancient Rome for example, Julius Caesar used pigeons to send messages across this Roman Empire. Although they were effective, pigieons were prone to getting lost or die in their travel.
            </p><p>&emsp;This all changed with the invention of the electrical telegraph in the late 19th century, which was the first fully digital communication system. Radiotelegraphy began to be used commercially in the early 20th century.
                By the 1920s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Nyquist">Harry Nyquist</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Hartley">Ralph Hartley</a> were developing fundamental theoretical work in telecommunications technology. 
            </p><p>&emsp;Digitized communication became the future, and this was all further enforced with the widespread use of digital computers
                on a government level. Radio was the standard means of communication, but it did have it's fair share of problems. The most common of which is weak signals or interference which could be caused by anything with an electrical or magnetic current, changing weather patterns or even something as simple as a bent radio antenna.

            <h2>Foundation</h2>
            <p>&emsp;Before the Internet came to be, it was just a bunch of various networks used by various countries. Said networks are:
                NPL network, a London-operated local area computer network,
                Merit Network, a nonprofit member-governed organization providing high-performance computer networking primarily in Michigan, a state in the United States of America,
                CYCLADES, a French research network pioneering networks experimenting with the concept of packet switching and explicitly designed to facilitate internetworking,
                and several others like X.25, public data networks, UUCP and Usenet. 
            </p><p>&emsp;These were all very important to their respective countries and/or regions, it wasn't until
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">Advanced Research Projects Agency Network</a>, or <b>ARPANET</b> for short, came along and merged with all the other local networks to form the basis of the Internet.
                <b>ARPANET</b> was special as it was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite,
                short for the Internet protocol suite, which is a framework for organizing the set of communication protocols used in the Internet and similar computer networks according to functional criteria.
            </p><p>&emsp;<b>ARPANET</b> was a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department.
                This all changed when <b>ARPANET</b> and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the <a href="InternetJob.html">TCP/IP</a> standard on January 1, 1983, that allowed different kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other.
                Hence, January 1st 1983 is officially considered the brithday of the Internet.

            <h2>World Wide Web and Global Internet</h2>
            <video width="560" height="315" controls="controls"><source src="CNN.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>
            <p>A report of the Web by CNN, a US-based news network</p>
            <p>&emsp;The World Wide Web (WWW) is an integral part of the internet, but it is important to distinguish between the two.
                The internet is a vast global network of interconnected computer networks, while the World Wide Web is a specific system for accessing information on the internet through a web browser.
                The Web was invented by English computer scientist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in 1989.
            </p><p>&emsp;He proposed a "universal linked information system" using several concepts and technologies, the most fundamental of which was the connections that existed between information.
                The first web server and web browser was developed by him as well as a document formatting protocal, called Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, which this very site is being coded in.
                After publishing the markup language in 1991, and releasing the browser source code for public use in 1993, many other web browsers were soon developed.
            </p><p>&emsp;Such notable examples include Mosaic and Netscape. Said browsers were notable for being particularly easy to use and install, and often credited with sparking the Internet boom of the 1990s.
                With the power to share anything and everything, Internet usage exploded in 1990s and early 2000s, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution">Digital Revolution</a> or the Third Industrial Revolution.
                The history of the World Wide Web up to around 2004 was retrospectively named and described by some as "Web 1.0".

            <h2>Networking... IN SPACE</h2>
            <p>&emsp;A common misconception about the Internet is that it runs on sattelite communication. For long distances, the Internet move arround through wires as thin as a strand of hair strung across the ocean floor.
                Nearly 1.2 million kilometres of cable already connect the continents to support the demand for communication and entertainment. Although this has been reliable,
                it has caused issues in the past such as in 2011 when web access was cut off from the whole of Armenia due to an elderly Georgian woman cutting through the copper wire.
            </p><p>&emsp;The solution, it turns out, was interplanetary internet. The first Internet link into low Earth orbit was established on January 22, 2010,
                when astronaut <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Creamer">T. J. Creamer</a> posted the first unassisted <a href="https://twitter.com/Astro_TJ/status/8062317551?lang=en">update to his Twitter account</a> from the International Space Station, marking the extension of the Internet into space.
                This Internet link consists of a set of network nodes that can communicate with each other. These nodes are the planet's orbiters and landers, and the Earth ground stations.
            </p><p>&emsp;It wouldn't be until a decade later when space networking became mainstream through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink">Starlink, a satellite internet constellation</a> operated by American aerospace company sSpaceX.
                The service provides coverage to over 60 countries, cosisting of over 5,000 mass-produced small satellites in low Earth orbit, which communicate with designated ground transceivers.

            <h2>The Internet and You</h2>
            <p>&emsp;To summarize, the history of the internet is a remarkable journey that spans several decades and has profoundly impacted the world.
                It began as a limited, government-funded network designed for research and military communication,
                and it has evolved into a global phenomenon that touches every aspect of modern society.
                In essence, the history of the internet is a testament to human ingenuity and the power of connectivity.
                It has brought about profound changes in the way we live, work, and interact,
                and it will undoubtedly continue to shape our future in ways that we can only imagine.
